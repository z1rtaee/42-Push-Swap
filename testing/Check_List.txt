--The program should work with several numerical arguments--
    ./push_swap 1 3 5 +9 20 -4 50 60 04 08

--The program also works if you receive a single string--
    ./push_swap "3 4 6 8 9 74 -56 +495"

--The program also works when strings and ints are mixed--
(this one is optional in my opinion but I choose to do it)
    ./push_swap "1 2 4 3" 76 90 "348 05"

--The program should NOT work if it encounters another character other than int--
                (the expected output should be "Error\n")
